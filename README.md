# Quotes Scrapper

---

**Quote Scraper**

This Python script utilizes web scraping techniques with the `requests` library to extract quotes, authors, and tags from a specified website. It parses the HTML content using `lxml` and organizes the data into a structured format using `pandas`. This tool can be used to gather inspirational quotes for analysis, display, or other applications.
